One morning when steve was out exploring he was far in the woods when he saw a temple. He went back to wake up alex and they both went in the temple to see what it was.
When they got in the temple they both noticed the place was rigged with boobytraps and had to be very carefull not to set any of them off.
When Steve walked forward he stepped on a pressure plate and arrows shot through the wall but luckly Alex saw him step on it and pushed him out of the way.
